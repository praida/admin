# Data

## Records

A record represents an administrative "dossier", often a person or family. It is characterized by a list of fields holding values of varying complexity.

## Fields

The fields need to be translatable and sharable across records, so that if we want to make sure a field always holds either nothing or a positive integer, we can make sure of it for all records.

## Users

Users are represented by a username and password and allow authentication to the system.
